The **GraphQL Foundation** is a neutral foundation founded by global technology and application development companies. The GraphQL Foundation encourages contributions, stewardship, and a shared investment from a broad group in vendor-neutral events, documentation, tools, and support for GraphQL.

GraphQL was created in 2012 and open sourced by Facebook in 2015. In 2019, Facebook and others [created the GraphQL Foundation](https://foundation.graphql.org/news/2019/03/12/the-graphql-foundation-announces-collaboration-with-the-joint-development-foundation-to-drive-open-source-and-open-standards/) as a neutral, non-profit home for the GraphQL assets and ongoing collaboration, and hosted by [The Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org). The GraphQL Foundation is a fully neutral home for the GraphQL trademark, and provides a means of collecting and distributing membership dues to support core community infrastructure and programs.
